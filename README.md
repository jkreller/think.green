# think.green

## What is think.green?
*think.green* is an iOS app which helps people to change their daily lives to safe the planet. It provides thoughts about what to do to live environmental friendly and why this is good.

The key principles of *think.green* are:
* Well designed user experience to access information as fast as possible
* Keep it simple but rich (provide valuable information understandably by the least necessary amount of text)

*think.green* was brought to life to learn Swift UI for myself but also creating a valuable app that helps people.

## Roadmap
* Evaluate and add backend (headless CMS)
* Populate information and go live
* Allow contributions
* Feature development
