# think.green

## What is think.green?
think.green is an iOS app which helps people to change their daily lives to safe the planet. It provides thoughts about what to do to live environmental friendly and why this is good.

The key principles of think.green are:
* Well designed user experience to access information as fast as possible
* Keep it simple but rich (provide valuable information understandably by the least necessary amount of text)

think.green was brought to life to learn Swift UI for myself but also creating a valuable app that helps people.

## Roadmap
Q1 2020: Start development of UI  
Q3 2020: Evaluate and add backend (headless CMS)  
Q4 2020: Populate information and go live

2021:
* Allow contributions
